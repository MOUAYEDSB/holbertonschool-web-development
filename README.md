# Project Title: HTML Structure Implementation from Designer File

## Overview

This project focuses on building the HTML structure of a webpage based on the provided designer file available on Figma. The goal is to recreate the design faithfully using semantic HTML without any styling or CSS.

### Design Details

- Designer File: [Link to Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=3558-0&mode=design&t=fp4lEOAJ5krLF9G5-0)
- Fonts: [Source Sans Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)
- Some Values: Rounded from floating-point values

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- **`assets/`**: Placeholder directory for future CSS, images, or additional resources.

## Getting Started
To view the webpage structure:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Implementation Details
### HTML Structure

The HTML structure adheres to semantic markup guidelines and mirrors the design elements provided in the Figma file. It's organized to reflect the layout, content hierarchy, and components outlined in the design.

## Notes
- All design specifications from the Figma file have been considered while creating the HTML structure.
- Any floating-point values in the design have been rounded as necessary to fit within the HTML structure.
